# 🛡️ QA & Ethical Security Practice Lab

Welcome to my personal repository for **QA automation, security testing, and ethical hacking practice**.  
This is where I experiment, fail, learn, and grow — one step at a time.

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

> *"Learning by doing — and always doing the right thing."*

This lab helps me develop:
- Stronger QA and scripting skills  
- A deeper understanding of how systems behave  
- Ethical awareness in software testing and security  
- Discipline and structure in self-learning

---

## 🧰 Tools & Areas Explored

### ✅ QA Testing & Automation
- Java + Selenium WebDriver  
- Manual Test Design (Test Cases, Edge Cases)  
- Exploratory testing of UI flows  
- Basic Git versioning & structure

### ✅ Python & CLI Scripting
- Small automation scripts (headless interaction, test flows)  
- API request testing with `requests`, `http.client`  
- Bash tools for workflow support

### ✅ Mobile Penetration Testing (Termux)
- CLI-based tools for ethical recon:  
  - `nmap`, `traceroute`, `whois`, `curl`, `ffuf`, `sqlmap`  
- Basic scripting in shell/Python  
- Performed on local virtual labs & test targets only

### ✅ Security Lab Exploration
- DOM-based XSS behavior tests  
- SQL injection simulation (in test environments)  
- Simple brute-force test logic (no real-world targets)  
- Rust & Python networking experiments (testing sockets, payloads, rate limiting)

### 🧪 Lab Environments
- VirtualBox VM (Kali, OWASP Juice Shop, DVWA)  
- Localhost HTML apps & intentionally vulnerable services  
- Controlled, isolated setups

## ⚖️ Ethics & Boundaries

This entire repository is created and maintained with **ethical learning as the top priority**.

- ✅ No unauthorized testing  
- ✅ No harm, no spam, no scraping  
- ✅ All test targets are either self-hosted or explicitly made for learning  
- ✅ My goal is to **build understanding, not cause damage**
