üõ°Ô∏è QA & Ethical Security Practice Lab
Welcome to my repository for QA automation, security testing, and ethical hacking practice. I learn by doing, prioritizing ethical approaches.

This lab focuses on experimental tools and red team techniques. I develop custom scanners (Go), automation scripts (Python, Bash), and cover QA (Java/Selenium). My work includes mobile/network testing and ethical hacking concepts like web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi simulations). All experiments are in controlled lab environments.
