# 🛡️ QA & Ethical Testing Practice

This is my personal practice space for learning test automation and basic security testing using Selenium.  
I’m using this project to improve my skills, explore how web applications behave, and test my own understanding step by step.

## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This

I believe in learning by doing — trying things out, breaking them (safely), and figuring out how to make them better.  
This repo helps me grow in QA, automation, and critical thinking.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Java  
- Selenium WebDriver  

(Planning to expand as I learn more.)

## ⚠️ Ethics First

All scripts here are for **learning and ethical purposes only**.  
I never test against real systems without permission — this is all done in safe environments.
