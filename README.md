# 🛡️ QA & Ethical Security Practice Lab

Welcome to my personal lab where I explore:

## 🔍 What I'm Practicing

- **QA Automation** using Java & Selenium WebDriver  
- **Security Testing** of web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi – in simulations)  
- **Scripting** with Python, Bash, and basic Go  
- **Network & OS Tools**: `nmap`, `traceroute`, basic TCP/IP debugging  
- **Virtualized Labs** via VirtualBox & Termux (Android)

## 🧠 Why This Exists

I believe in *learning by doing* — setting up test environments, breaking things safely, and understanding how systems behave under edge conditions.

This lab helps me grow in:
- Test automation
- Web security awareness
- Command-line fluency
- Responsible use of tools

## ⚖️ Ethics First

Everything here is for **educational** and **ethical** purposes only.  
I never target real systems. All tests are run in *isolated lab environments*.  
The goal is to **build skills, not cause harm**.
