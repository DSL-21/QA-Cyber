# 🧪 QA & Security Practice Lab

This is my personal testing ground for:

- 🔹 QA Automation (Selenium + Java)
- 🔹 Ethical Hacking Labs (XSS, SQLi, etc.)
- 🔹 CLI & Network Tools (nmap, traceroute)
- 🔹 Scripting (Python, Bash, Go – beginner)

💡 All tests are run in isolated environments using VirtualBox or Termux.  
⚠️ Always ethical. No real-world targets. Ever.
