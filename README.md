# 🛡️ Ethical Web Pentesting with Selenium

This repository is a growing personal portfolio focused on ethical web automation and security testing using Selenium WebDriver in Java.  
It combines practical experience in UI interaction, vulnerability exploration, and test logic — built step by step with discipline and curiosity.

## 📚 What You'll Find

A collection of self-built automation scripts simulating both functional user flows and edge-case security scenarios — all in a safe, controlled environment.  
Tests are designed to explore behavior, push boundaries, and reflect real-world challenges testers and defenders face every day.

Whether it's a broken login flow, unsafe DOM manipulation, or missing input validation — each test adds another brick to the wall of experience.

> This project is for **educational and ethical purposes only**.  
All tests target known demo or intentionally vulnerable sites.  
Never run such scripts against real-world systems without explicit permission.

## ✝️ Why This Exists

Breaking something is easy.  
Understanding **why** it broke — and how to fix it — is a step closer to mastery.  
This is not just about testing software, but testing self-discipline, patience, and the resolve to build something better.
