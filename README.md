üõ°Ô∏è QA & Ethical Security Practice Lab
Welcome to my repository for QA automation, security testing, and ethical hacking practice. I learn by doing, always prioritizing ethical approaches.

This lab focuses on developing and exploring:

Experimental Tools & Red Team Techniques: Crafting custom scanners (Go), automation scripts (Python, Bash).

QA & Test Design: Covering Java/Selenium fundamentals.

Mobile & Network Testing: Utilizing CLI tools like nmap and traceroute.

Ethical Hacking Concepts: Including web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi simulations).

All experiments are conducted in controlled lab environments.

My goal: forge skills, prevent harm.
