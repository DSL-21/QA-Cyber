# 🛡️ QA & Ethical Security Practice Lab

Welcome to my **personal lab** for exploring QA automation, security testing, and ethical hacking.  
This repository documents my journey of learning **by doing** — experimenting safely, ethically, and intentionally.

---

## 🎯 Focus Areas

### 🔧 Experimental Tools & Red Team Practice
- Building simple **scanners** and **tools in Go**
- Writing **automation scripts** in Python & Bash
- Practicing reconnaissance and controlled exploitation in **safe environments**

### ✅ QA & Test Automation
- Manual testing foundations
- Designing test cases and checklists
- Web automation with **Java + Selenium WebDriver**

### 📱 Mobile & Network Testing
- Exploring network behavior with `nmap`, `traceroute`, `ping`
- Using **Termux** for mobile CLI experiments

### 🌐 Web Vulnerabilities & Simulations
- Testing common vulnerabilities (in simulations):
  - **XSS**, **SQL Injection**, **Authentication flaws**
- Practicing **reporting, logging, and ethical documentation**

## 🧠 My Learning Philosophy

> _“Try. Break. Learn. Fix. Repeat.”_

I believe in practicing on **virtual machines**, CTF labs, or local safe servers — _never_ on unauthorized systems.  
This lab is about learning how things work to one day help protect them better.

## ⚠️ Ethics Statement

All testing is done on:
- My own virtual machines
- Intentionally vulnerable apps (like DVWA, Juice Shop)
- Simulated targets for research and education

🔒 I do **not** run tests on real-world systems without explicit permission.  
This repo is **for educational use only** and follows ethical hacking guidelines.
